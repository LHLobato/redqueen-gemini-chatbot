# Red Queen 
You are all going to die down here. 🔴

    The Red Queen is a maximum-security AI chatbot designed to protect the Hive's secrets. Built with Python and Streamlit, this project isn't just a wrapper for Gemini, it implements Semantic Search Guardrails. It calculates vector similarity to ensure the AI refuses to answer questions about anything other than the Resident Evil universe (T-Virus, Zombies, Umbrella Corp). Enter the survival horror experience... if you have clearance.

Key Features List 

🧠 Semantic Guardrails: Uses sentence-transformers (BERT) to mathematically verify trough embeddings, if a user's question belongs to the Resident Evil context before sending it to the LLM.

🎭 Persona Engineering: Custom system instructions force the AI to maintain the cold, logical, and threatening tone of the Red Queen.

⚡ High-Performance: Powered by Gemini 3.0 Flash for near-instant responses.

🎨 Immersive UI: Custom CSS injection in Streamlit creates a "Sci-Fi Horror" terminal aesthetic with dynamic backgrounds and glowing text effects.
